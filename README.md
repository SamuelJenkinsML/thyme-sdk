# Thyme SDK

Real-time ML features. Defined in Python. Computed in Rust.

Thyme is a streaming feature platform that eliminates training/serving skew. You define features once in Python; Thyme compiles them to a continuously-running Rust engine that keeps values fresh as events arrive.

## The Problem

You train a model offline on historical data. The offline metrics look great. You deploy it. Within weeks, production accuracy drops — not because the model is wrong, but because the features it sees in production are computed differently than the features it trained on.

This is **training/serving skew** — the most common silent killer of production ML systems. It comes from:

- **Separate batch and streaming pipelines** — Training features are computed in Spark/dbt/SQL, serving features in Flink or custom microservices. These pipelines diverge silently.
- **Hand-rolled feature stores** — Aggregation logic is copy-pasted between batch ETL and streaming jobs. Changes get made in one place, not both.
- **Stale features at serving time** — Batch pipelines run hourly or daily. Your model sees yesterday's data while making today's decisions.

## How Thyme Solves It

### One definition, two modes

You write a feature once in Python. Thyme compiles it to:

- **Streaming aggregation** — a continuously-running Rust process that keeps values fresh within milliseconds of new events arriving
- **Point-in-time lookup** — the same logic applied to historical data at any past timestamp for offline training

There is one source of truth. The online and offline paths are guaranteed consistent.

### Declarative, not operational

You declare *what* a feature is, not *how* to run it. You don't manage Kafka consumers, RocksDB compaction, or checkpoint recovery. Thyme handles the infrastructure; you own the feature logic.

## Business Benefits

- **Faster ML iteration** — Define a new feature, commit it, and it's live. No pipeline deployment, no backfill coordination, no ops ticket.
- **Fewer production incidents** — Training/serving parity is structural, not a convention you enforce manually.
- **Smaller infrastructure footprint** — One system replaces the batch ETL, the streaming job, and the custom serving layer.
- **Safe schema evolution** — Features have integer IDs. You can add, rename, and version features without breaking downstream consumers.

## Architecture Overview

```
Python SDK          →  Definition Service  →  Engine             →  Query Server
(this repo)            (Rust, port 8080)      (Rust, streaming)     (Rust, port 8081)
                            |                      |
                         Postgres              RocksDB state
                         Kafka topics          (keyed by entity + timestamp)
```

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Python SDK** | Declarative API for defining datasets, pipelines, featuresets, and sources. The `thyme commit` CLI sends definitions to the control plane. |
| **Definition Service** | Receives commit payloads, builds an entity dependency graph, generates job blueprints, creates Kafka topics, and persists metadata to Postgres. |
| **Engine** | Streaming engine that runs continuously. Spawns source connectors and pipeline runners. Consumes from Kafka, executes windowed aggregations, and writes results to RocksDB. |
| **Query Server** | Reads features from RocksDB, resolves featureset metadata, runs Python extractors via PyO3, and returns JSON. |

## SDK Features

- **Declarative DSL** — `@dataset`, `@pipeline`, `@featureset`, and `@source` decorators define your feature graph
- **Multiple connectors** — Iceberg, Postgres, S3 JSON, and local JSONL sources
- **Aggregation operators** — `Avg`, `Count`, `Sum`, `Min`, `Max` with configurable time windows
- **LLM-powered discovery** — `thyme discover` introspects a data source and generates feature definitions using AI
- **Testing framework** — `MockContext` for unit testing pipelines without infrastructure
- **CLI tools** — `commit`, `status`, `logs`, `discover` for managing the feature lifecycle

## Core Concepts

### Dataset

A dataset is a named, typed stream of events — the fundamental data container in Thyme.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from thyme import dataset, field

@dataset(index=True, version=1)
class Transaction:
    user_id: str      = field(key=True)
    amount:  float    = field()
    ts:      datetime = field(timestamp=True)
```

Every dataset has a **key field** (the entity identifier, used for grouping) and a **timestamp field** (event time, used for windowed aggregations). Setting `index=True` maintains a fast lookup index in RocksDB for query-time access.

### Pipeline

A pipeline is a windowed aggregation that continuously transforms one dataset into another. Defined as a method on the output dataset class:

```python
from thyme import pipeline, inputs, Avg, Count

@dataset(index=True, version=1)
class UserStats:
    user_id:       str      = field(key=True)
    avg_amount_7d: float    = field()
    txn_count_30d: int      = field()
    ts:            datetime = field(timestamp=True)

    @pipeline(version=1)
    @inputs(Transaction)
    def compute(cls, txns):
        return txns.groupby("user_id").aggregate(
            avg_amount_7d=Avg(of="amount", window="7d"),
            txn_count_30d=Count(of="user_id", window="30d"),
        )
```

Pipeline bodies are **lazy** — they return `PipelineNode` descriptions of the computation. No data is processed at import or commit time. The Rust engine compiles the DAG and executes it as a streaming job.

**Aggregation operators:**

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `Avg(of, window)` | Rolling mean of a numeric field |
| `Count(of, window)` | Rolling count of events |
| `Sum(of, window)` | Rolling sum of a numeric field |
| `Min(of, window)` | Rolling minimum |
| `Max(of, window)` | Rolling maximum |

Windows are specified as strings: `"7d"` (7 days), `"24h"` (24 hours), `"30m"` (30 minutes). All windows use **event time**, not processing time.

### Featureset

A featureset is a named collection of features that your models and applications consume — the public API of your feature pipeline.

```python
from thyme import featureset, feature, extractor, extractor_inputs, extractor_outputs

@featureset
class UserFeatures:
    uid:           str   = feature(id=1)
    avg_spend_7d:  float = feature(id=2)
    txn_count_30d: int   = feature(id=3)

    @extractor
    @extractor_inputs("uid")
    @extractor_outputs("avg_spend_7d", "txn_count_30d")
    def from_stats(cls, ts, inputs):
        uid = inputs["uid"]
        row = UserStats.lookup(ts, user_id=uid)
        return row["avg_amount_7d"], row["txn_count_30d"]
```

Features have **integer IDs** for stable schema evolution — you can rename features without breaking downstream consumers. Extractors run in Python inside the query server at serving time.

### Source

A source connects an external data system to a dataset. The engine polls the source on a schedule and publishes new rows to Kafka.

```python
from thyme import source, IcebergSource

@source(
    IcebergSource(catalog="prod", database="events", table="transactions"),
    cursor="ts",
    every="1m",
    disorder="5m",
    cdc="append",
)
@dataset(index=True, version=1)
class Transaction:
    user_id: str      = field(key=True)
    amount:  float    = field()
    ts:      datetime = field(timestamp=True)
```

**Available connectors:** `IcebergSource`, `PostgresSource`, `S3JsonSource`, and local JSONL.

**CDC modes:** `append` (insert-only event logs), `upsert` (keyed updates), `debezium` (full CDC envelopes).

## Quick Start Example

A complete example showing all four primitives together — computing restaurant rating features from review events:

```python
from datetime import datetime
from thyme import dataset, field, pipeline, inputs, Avg, Count
from thyme import featureset, feature, extractor, extractor_inputs, extractor_outputs
from thyme import source, IcebergSource

# 1. Define the input dataset with a source connector
@source(
    IcebergSource(catalog="prod", database="reviews", table="restaurant_reviews"),
    cursor="timestamp",
    every="1m",
    disorder="5m",
    cdc="append",
)
@dataset(index=True, version=1)
class Review:
    restaurant_id: str   = field(key=True)
    rating:        float = field()
    timestamp:     datetime = field(timestamp=True)

# 2. Define an aggregated dataset with a pipeline
@dataset(index=True, version=1)
class RestaurantRatingStats:
    restaurant_id:   str      = field(key=True)
    avg_rating_24h:  float    = field()
    review_count_7d: float    = field()
    timestamp:       datetime = field(timestamp=True)

    @pipeline(version=1)
    @inputs(Review)
    def compute(cls, reviews):
        return reviews.groupby("restaurant_id").aggregate(
            avg_rating_24h=Avg(of="rating", window="24h"),
            review_count_7d=Count(of="rating", window="7d"),
        )

# 3. Define a featureset with an extractor
@featureset
class RestaurantFeatures:
    restaurant_id:   str   = feature(id=1)
    avg_rating_24h:  float = feature(id=2)
    review_count_7d: int   = feature(id=3)

    @extractor(deps=[RestaurantRatingStats])
    @extractor_inputs("restaurant_id")
    @extractor_outputs("avg_rating_24h", "review_count_7d")
    def from_stats(cls, ts, inputs):
        rid = inputs["restaurant_id"]
        row = RestaurantRatingStats.lookup(ts, restaurant_id=rid)
        return row["avg_rating_24h"], row["review_count_7d"]
```

## CLI Reference

The `thyme` CLI manages the feature lifecycle:

### `thyme commit`

Send feature definitions to the control plane.

```bash
# Commit from a file
thyme commit features.py

# Commit from a module path
thyme commit -m myproject.features

# Dry-run: print the payload without sending
thyme commit features.py --dry-run

# Write payload to a file
thyme commit features.py --dry-run --output payload.json
```

### `thyme status`

Show system status: committed definitions, running jobs, and service health.

```bash
thyme status
thyme status --json
```

### `thyme logs`

Show recent service events (commits, errors, backfills).

```bash
thyme logs
thyme logs --severity error
thyme logs --type backfill --limit 20
thyme logs --json
```

### `thyme discover`

AI-powered feature discovery. Introspects a data source schema and generates Thyme feature definitions.

```bash
# From an Iceberg table
thyme discover --source-type iceberg \
    --catalog prod --database events --table transactions \
    --use-case "fraud detection" \
    --output features.py

# From a local JSONL file
thyme discover --source-type jsonl \
    --path data/events.jsonl \
    --use-case "user engagement" \
    --output features.py --auto-commit

# From Postgres
thyme discover --source-type postgres \
    --pg-host localhost --pg-database mydb --pg-table orders \
    --pg-user admin --pg-password secret \
    --use-case "demand forecasting"
```

## Testing

The SDK includes `MockContext` — an in-memory pipeline simulator that mirrors the Rust engine's semantics without requiring any infrastructure.

```python
from thyme.testing import MockContext

def test_restaurant_ratings():
    ctx = MockContext()

    # Ingest events
    ctx.add_events(Review, [
        {"restaurant_id": "r1", "rating": 4.5, "timestamp": "2026-03-15T10:00:00Z"},
        {"restaurant_id": "r1", "rating": 3.5, "timestamp": "2026-03-15T11:00:00Z"},
        {"restaurant_id": "r1", "rating": 5.0, "timestamp": "2026-03-15T12:00:00Z"},
    ])

    # Check raw aggregates
    aggs = ctx.get_aggregates(RestaurantRatingStats, "r1")
    assert aggs["avg_rating_24h"] == pytest.approx(4.333, abs=0.01)
    assert aggs["review_count_7d"] == 3.0

    # Query through the featureset extractor
    features = ctx.query(RestaurantFeatures, "r1")
    assert features["avg_rating_24h"] == pytest.approx(4.333, abs=0.01)
```

`MockContext` supports:
- `add_events(dataset_class, events)` — ingest events and process through registered pipelines; returns expectation violations
- `get_aggregates(dataset_class, entity_id)` — get raw aggregated values for an entity
- `query(featureset_class, entity_id)` — run the full extractor chain and return feature values
